Several additional documents describing the data set and pointing to additional Bibliography are made available (including the white paper: Bronnenberg, Bart J., Kruger, Michael W, and Mela, Carl F. The IRI Marketing Dataset.).  Getting to know this data set is time well spent as it will be very applicable towards the Final project.  The data set is of medium size and complexity – however understanding the data and how file/folders/datasets related to each other will be of crucial importance for creating an appropriate training data set.  \n",
    "The data set has been purchase by UCSD, it is only for internal use and comes with restrictions.  Please read and follow the NDA specified at the very end of the “IRI_database_technical_appendix” document provided with the data set.  \n",
